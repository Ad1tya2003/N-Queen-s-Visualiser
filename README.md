# N-Queens Visualizer

## Overview
The N-Queens Visualizer is a tool to visualize the solution of the N-Queens problem, a classic problem in computer science and combinatorics. The goal of the problem is to place `N` queens on an `N x N` chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.

This visualizer provides an intuitive and interactive way to see how the N-Queens problem is solved.

## Features
- Visual representation of the N-Queens problem.
- Step-by-step animation of the backtracking algorithm.
- Support for different board sizes (N can be adjusted).

## Installation

To run the N-Queens Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ad1tya2003/N-Queen-s-Visualiser.git
cd N-Queen-s-Visualiser
